Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub.
This is primarily used as my playground to learn and test new tools and
technologies. If you would like to learn more about me go to [[https://www.ethancpost.com][my website]]. If you
feel that you can learn anything from me or the things I have learned I publicly
publish all of the notes I have ever made: [[https://notes.ethancpost.com][here]].

If you would like a copy of my Resume you can find it here:
